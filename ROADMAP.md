# Nauqtype Roadmap

## MVP Definition

Nauqtype "compiles and runs code" when all of the following are true:

- a `.nq` program is lexed and parsed successfully
- names resolve
- a meaningful subset type-checks
- move/borrow rules are enforced for the supported subset
- the compiler emits readable C
- the emitted C is compiled by a system C compiler
- the produced executable runs successfully
- example programs and tests cover the path

## Working Vertical Slice

The first real success target is:

- one source file
- `fn main() -> i32`
- local bindings
- arithmetic and boolean expressions
- structs
- enums
- `result` / `option`
- `if`
- `match`
- explicit `return`
- `print_line`
- minimal move / borrow checking

## Milestones

### M0: Locked Design

- write research memo
- write spec, grammar, architecture, decisions, risks
- freeze v0.1 scope

### M1: Scaffold And Diagnostics Core

- create bootstrap compiler package layout
- add shared span and diagnostic types
- add CLI shape

### M2: Lexer And Parser

- tokenize the v0.1 grammar
- parse items, statements, expressions, patterns, and types
- add parser golden tests

### M3: Resolution And Type Checking

- resolve top-level and local names
- type-check functions, structs, enums, calls, returns, and matches
- emit stable semantic diagnostics

### M4: Minimal Ownership Enforcement

- classify copy vs move types
- detect use-after-move
- validate `ref` / `mutref` rules for calls

### M5: IR And C Emission

- lower checked programs to a small typed IR
- emit readable C
- include tiny runtime support

### M6: End-to-End Execution

- compile generated C with a detected system C compiler
- run example programs
- add integration coverage

### M7: Lints And Hardening

- `unused_mut`
- discarded `result`
- stabilize diagnostic wording

## Feature Ordering

Features required before first success:

- lexer
- parser
- diagnostics
- resolution
- type checker
- move/borrow checker
- C emitter
- runtime support
- executable runner

Features explicitly not required before first success:

- imports
- user-defined generics
- methods
- loops
- file I/O
- collection types

## v0.2+ Candidates

- cross-file modules
- user-defined generics
- methods / `impl`
- loops
- propagation sugar
- richer standard library
- stronger borrow analysis
- direct native backend exploration

## Testing Milestones

- M2: lexer and parser tests
- M3: resolver and type tests
- M4: borrow tests
- M5: C emission goldens
- M6: full example execution tests
- M7: diagnostic and lint snapshots

## Diagnostics Milestones

- lexer spans present at M1
- parse diagnostics stable by M2
- type and resolve diagnostics stable by M3
- borrow diagnostics stable by M4
- lint diagnostics added by M7

## Scope Freeze Rule

After M0, changes to core syntax or semantics require:

- a recorded decision entry
- a stated blocker or contradiction
- a stated impact on implementation and docs
